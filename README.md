## 💡 Why Neural?

**There are many excellent translation services out there. But I had specific needs:**

DeepL and Google Translate are fantastic services. However, for users like me who need:

- **Instant translations** (real-time chat, simultaneous interpretation)
- **Offline capability** (airplanes, trains, secure environments)
- **Privacy-first approach** (confidential documents, personal data)
- **Unlimited usage** (hundreds of translations per day)
- **Minimal resource usage** (only 150MB when idle!)

I decided to build **my own translation environment leveraging the M4 Mac's incredible performance**.

The result? **Neural translates in 0.3-1.2 seconds (after warmup), uses minimal memory, and works completely offline.**

## 🚀 Features

### ⚡ Lightning-Fast Translation
- **0.3-1.2 seconds** - Ultra-fast local translation (after model warmup)
- **100% local processing** - No internet required, complete privacy
- **M4 Mac optimized** - Leverages Apple Neural Engine and Metal GPU
- **~21 second cold start** - First translation includes model loading

### 🎯 Three AI Models to Choose From

| Model | Speed* | Use Case | Memory |
|-------|--------|----------|--------|
| **Qwen 2.5 3B** 🚀 | 0.3-1.2s | Tested - Quick translation, low memory | 1.9GB |
| **Aya 23 8B** 🥇 | Not tested | Translation-specialized model | 4.8GB |
| **Llama 3.1 8B** 📚 | Not tested | High quality, detailed output | 4.9GB |

*Warm performance (after model loading). Cold start adds ~21s.

### 💎 Key Features
- **Real-time performance monitor** - CPU/Memory/GPU usage visualization
- **Drag & drop support** - Translate text files directly
- **AI text enhancement** - Automatically improve translation quality
- **Multi-language support** - Japanese, English, Chinese, Korean, Spanish, French, German
- **Global hotkey** - ⌘+C+C for quick launch
- **Translation history** - Automatic save of past translations
- **Ultra-low memory usage** - Only 150MB when idle (1/4 of Electron apps!)

## 📋 System Requirements

- **OS**: macOS 12.0 or later
- **CPU**: Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4) recommended
- **Memory**: 8GB minimum (16GB recommended)
- **Storage**: 10GB free space

| Clear text | ⌘+K | Clear input text |
| Copy result | ⌘+C | Copy translation result |

## 🔬 How It's So Fast

### 1. Ollama Inference Optimization
- **Metal-optimized llama.cpp** for direct GPU control
- **Quantized models (Q4_K_M)** - 4x faster with maintained accuracy
- **KV cache optimization** for faster context processing
- **Parallel batch inference** utilizing all CPU cores

### 2. Native Performance with Tauri + Rust
- **No Chromium overhead** unlike Electron
- **1/3 memory usage** (200MB vs Electron's 600MB)
- **Direct OS API access**
- **3x faster startup** (1s vs 3s)

### 3. Translation-Optimized Models
- **Aya 23**: Cohere's multilingual specialist
- **101 language support** with excellent Japanese performance
- **Pre-trained for translation tasks**
- **Deep context understanding** for nuanced translations

### 4. Apple Silicon Optimization
- **Neural Engine utilization** (up to 15.8 TOPS)
- **Unified Memory** - zero CPU-GPU data copying
- **Metal Performance Shaders** for accelerated matrix operations
- **M4-specific optimizations** (ARMv9.2-A instruction set)

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

### Real Translation Speed Results (2025-08-07)

**Actual measured performance** on MacBook Air M4 with qwen2.5:3b model:

```
Translation Performance (after warmup):
Short text (12 words)  : 327ms - 369ms  ⚡⚡⚡
Medium text (22 words) : 676ms - 861ms  ⚡⚡  
Long text (38 words)   : 829ms - 1,216ms ⚡

Average warm performance: 685ms
Cold start (first run): ~21 seconds (includes model loading)

Test Environment: MacBook Air M4, qwen2.5:3b (1.9GB model)
```

### Performance Characteristics
- **Warm translation**: 0.3-1.2 seconds consistently
- **Cold start penalty**: ~21s first translation (model loading)
- **Memory usage**: 1.9GB model + ~150MB app overhead
- **Completely offline**: No network dependency
- **Unlimited usage**: No API limits or costs
- **Privacy-first**: All processing stays local

**📋 See [PERFORMANCE.md](PERFORMANCE.md) for detailed benchmark methodology and results.**
